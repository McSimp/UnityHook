UnityHook
=========

Allows you to inject a .NET library with a MonoBehaviour into a Unity standalone game.

Kind of broken
==============

This will only work out of the box with a very specific standalone game since the offset to the game loop is hard coded into the code for the injected DLL. This might also not work with builds that are not a "Development Build". 

If you are actually interested in using this, email me - will@mcsi.mp - and I can help you out.
